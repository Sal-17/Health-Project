Hospital Readmission Patterns
# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis – Hospital Readmissions

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission data to identify **risk factors**, evaluate **healthcare utilization patterns**, and provide **actionable recommendations** for reducing avoidable readmissions.  
It demonstrates a full **data science workflow**: dataset setup, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and professional healthcare visualizations.

## 🔑 Features
- **Dataset Setup**  
  - Loads the Diabetes Readmission dataset (UCI/OpenML).  
  - If unavailable, generates a realistic synthetic dataset (5,000 patients).  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Readmission rates and 30-day benchmark comparison  
  - Demographics: age groups, gender distributions  
  - Clinical factors: length of stay, medications, procedures  
  - Utilization: outpatient, ER, inpatient visits  
  - Diabetes management (A1C test results, medication usage)  
  - Admission type & discharge disposition analysis  

- **Professional Visualizations**  
  - Hospital readmission distribution pie chart  
  - Readmission risk by age, admission type, diabetes control  
  - Length of stay impact on readmissions  
  - Heatmaps for medical complexity  
  - KPI summary box with insights and recommendations

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🚨 **30-day readmission rate**: ~11% (benchmark: 15–20%).  
- 👥 **Elderly patients (65+)** have significantly higher readmission risk.  
- 🏥 **Long hospital stays (7+ days)** increase likelihood of readmission.  
- 🚑 **High ER utilizers (2+ visits)** are more likely to return within 30 days.  
- 💊 **Poor diabetes management** (A1C > 7) correlates with higher readmissions.  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data wrangling & processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **SciPy** – Statistical testing  
- **scikit-learn** – Dataset fetching  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Build predictive machine learning models for high-risk patient identification.  
2. Develop SQL queries for data extraction from hospital systems.  
3. Create Excel dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.  
4. Write an **executive healthcare report** summarizing insights and recommendations.  

---

## 📌 Portfolio Impact
This project showcases:  
- Advanced **data visualization** and dashboard design  
- Strong **healthcare domain knowledge**  
- Ability to deliver **business-ready insights**  
- Professional, **presentation-ready outputs**
